🚩 FlagPro Shift Scheduling System Simulation

A robust simulation tool designed to model and visualize the complexities of shift scheduling for dynamic, on-demand workforces, such as traffic flaggers and event staff.

This application simulates the entire lifecycle of worker management and scheduling, from recruitment to dispatch, providing insight into workforce availability and rotation patterns.

✨ Key Features

Dynamic Worker Pool: Simulates an initial pool of workers drawn from "App Signups," modeling a real-world influx of new applicants.

Recruitment Pipeline: Includes a simulation of the recruitment, verification, and onboarding process for new workers.

Automated Schedule Generation: Automatically generates complex, alternating shift schedules based on user-defined parameters.

Dispatch Simulation: Models the process of dispatching workers to job sites, complete with notes for geofencing and location verification.

Configurable Parameters: Allows you to define the core logic of the schedule, including the start date, cycle length, and number of cycles to project.

🚀 How to Use the Simulator

Follow these steps to run a new scheduling simulation:

Navigate to Controls: Locate the "Scheduling Controls" section (typically on the sidebar).

Set Parameters:

Schedule Start Date: Select the initial date from which to begin the simulation.

Rotation Cycle Length: Define the total length (e.g., in days or weeks) of one full schedule rotation.

Number of Cycles to Generate: Set how many complete rotations you want the simulation to project into the future.

Run Simulation: Initiate the simulation (e.g., by clicking a "Generate" or "Run" button).

Review Output: Observe the results in the main output area, which will detail the processes below.

⚙️ Understanding the Simulation Output

When you run the simulation, you will see a log detailing several key processes:

Worker Pool Initialization: The system simulates the creation of an initial worker database from "App Signups."

Simulated Recruitment: Watch as the simulation models the process of new applicants moving through the recruitment and verification pipeline.

Schedule Generation: The core output showing the generated alternating schedules for the active worker pool.

Dispatch Simulation: See a log of simulated dispatch events, including notes on geofencing checks for worker check-ins
